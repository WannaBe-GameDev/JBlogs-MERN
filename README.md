![Blogging Web Application](https://yourimageurlhere.com)

## Introduction
This project is a Blogging Web Application built from scratch using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The primary objective was to gain hands-on experience with basic CRUD operations in MongoDB while also delving into the development of a full-fledged web application using React and Express.

## Functionalities
1. **Register:** Users can register for an account by providing necessary details.
2. **Login:** Registered users can log in securely to access their account.
3. **Create Posts:** Authenticated users can create new blog posts with titles, content, and any additional media.
4. **Read Posts:** Users can view existing blog posts on the platform.

## Tools/Concepts Used
- **CORS:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for secure communication between frontend and backend.
- **React Context:** Used for state management, providing a centralized data store accessible throughout the application.
- **Mongoose:** Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, facilitating schema-based solutions.
- **Relationships with NoSQL DBs:** Implementing relationships between data entities in MongoDB.
- **Cookies & Sessions:** Utilized for user authentication and maintaining user sessions.
- **CSS:** Custom styling for an attractive user interface.
